### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.45.2
- Disable user authentication extension by default

## [1.8.3] - 2024-01-31

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.45.1

## [1.8.2] - 2024-01-16

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.45.0

## [1.8.1] - 2023-12-02

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.44.2
- Applied several modifications to improve support for SQLite3 WASM

### Fixed

- Fixed issue [#133](../../issues/133)) - missing API symbols

## [1.8.0] - 2023-11-23

### Added

- Added new cipher scheme Ascon-128

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.44.1
- Updated CMake support

### Fixed

- Fixed issue [#126](../../issues/126)) - use of quadmath in VSV extension. Use of 128-bit floats for conversion purposes in the VSV extension could cause compilation problems due to the dependency on the GCC-specific quadmath library. This library will now only be used, if the preprocessor symbol `SQLITE_USE_QUADMATH` is defined. This symbol will not be defined by default.

## [1.7.4] - 2023-11-09

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.44.0
- Prevent crashes due to uninitialized cipher tables

## [1.7.3] - 2023-11-05

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.44.0

## [1.7.2] - 2023-10-11

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.43.2

## [1.7.1] - 2023-10-09

### Added

- Added compile time option to omit AES hardware support

### Fixed

- Fixed autoconf/automake build files to be usable with msys/mingw

## [1.7.0] - 2023-10-03

### Added

- Added `PRAGMA memory_security` to allow to clear memory before it is freed. This feature can have a considerable impact on performance and is therefore disabled by default.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue [#118](../../issues/118)) - tvOS/watchOS compilation errors. On Apple platforms the function `SecRandomCopyBytes()` will now be used instead of `getentropy()`.
- Fixed issue [#119](../../issues/119)) - `PRAGMA mmap_size` conflicts with encrypted databases, a check has been added to allow this pragma for unencrypted databases.

## [1.6.5] - 2023-09-14

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.43.1

## [1.6.4] - 2023-08-25

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.41.2

## [1.6.1] - 2023-03-14

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.41.1
- Symbol `MAX_PATHNAME` (used on Unix-like platforms) has a fixed value of **512** in the original SQLite source code. This can now be configured at compile time to use a higher value (like **4096** - which is supported by most Linux variants) (see issue [#104](../../issues/104)). Use symbol `SQLITE3MC_MAX_PATHNAME` to define a higher value.

## [1.6.0] - 2023-02-23

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.41.0
- Added CMake build support (thanks to [@lwttai](https://github.com/lwttai) and [@jammerxd](https://github.com/jammerxd)

### Added

- Added automatic VFS shim instantiation (see issue [#104](../../issues/104))
  To enable encryption support for a non-default VFS it is now enough to specify the name of the requested real VFS with the prefix **multipleciphers-**, either via the URI parameter `vfs` or via the 4th parameter of the SQLite API function `sqlite3_open_v2()`.

:warning:️ **Important Information when operating SQLite in WAL journal mode** :warning:️

To allow concurrent use of SQLite databases in WAL journal mode with legacy encryption implementations like [System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org) or [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) a new WAL journal encryption implementation was introduced in _SQLite Multiple Ciphers version **1.3.0**_. 

Unfortunately, WAL journals left behind by versions <= 1.2.5 are not compatible with this new implementation. To be able to access WAL journals created by prior versions, the configuration parameter `mc_legacy_wal` was introduced. If the parameter is set to 1, then the prior WAL journal encryption mode is used. The default of this parameter can be set at compile time by setting the symbol `SQLITE3MC_LEGACY_WAL` accordingly, but the actual value can also be set at runtime using the pragma or the URI parameter `mc_legacy_wal`.

In principle, operating generally in WAL legacy mode is possible, but it is strongly recommended to use the WAL legacy mode only to recover WAL journals left behind by prior versions without data loss.

### Added

- Added configuration parameter `mc_legacy_wal` (issue #40)

### Fixed

- Issue [#39](../../issues/39): Corrupted WAL journal due to referencing the wrong codec pointer

## [1.3.1] - 2021-04-28

:stop_sign: **Attention** :stop_sign:

As described in issue [#39](../../issues/39) using SQLite in _WAL journal mode_ is broken in this version.

### Changed

- Prevent rekey in WAL journal mode, because performing a rekeying operation (`PRAGMA rekey`) in WAL journal mode could cause database corruption.

### Fixed

- Fix issue in user authentication extension that prevented VACUUMing or rekeying

## [1.3.0] - 2021-04-23

:stop_sign: **Attention** :stop_sign:

As described in issue [#39](../../issues/39) using SQLite in _WAL journal mode_ is broken in this version.

### Changed

- Based on SQLite version 3.35.5
- Adjusted build files for MinGW
  The compile option was changed from **-march=native** to **-msse4.2 -maes**. Additionally, the MinGW variant _TDM-GCC_ is now supported by replacing the use of `RtlGenRandom` (aka `SystemFunction036`) with the use of the standard function `rand_s` (which internally calls `RtlGenRandom`). The direct call to `RtlGenRandom` can be activated by defining the compile time symbol `SQLITE3MC_USE_RAND_S=0`.

### Fixed

- Issue [#37](../../issues/37): Allow concurrent access from legacy applications by establishing WAL journal mode compatibility
  This change allows concurrent use of applications still using SQLite versions (< 3.32.0) based on the `SQLITE_HAS_CODEC` encryption API and applications using the new _SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers_ implementation in WAL journal mode.
- Issue [#36](../../issues/36): Clear pager cache after setting a new passphrase to force a reread of the database header

- AES 256 Bit CBC - No HMAC ([wxSQLite3](https://github.com/utelle/wxsqlite3))
- ChaCha20 - Poly1305 HMAC ([sqleet](https://github.com/resilar/sqleet), _default_)
- AES 256 Bit CBC - SHA1/SHA256/SHA512 HMAC ([SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/), database versions 1, 2, 3, and 4)
